### About
`Ivan Platonov`
I am cyber security bachelor student @ Innopolis University, also work here as a Middle CyberSec specialist for over a year. 
Key professional interest for now is IT infrastructures, and ways to make them secure and reliable. Repos you might see bellow are mostly my practice with technologies or University assignments.
